Testing accessing the OPENAI API - all code generated by ChatGPT.

"You are a world class software engineer.

I need you to draft a technical software spec for building the following:
A program to send calls to the OPENAI API with a simple GUI to choose which api calls to make.

Think through how you would build it step by step.

Then, respond with the complete spec as a well-organized markdown file.

I will then reply with "build," and you will proceed to implement the exact spec, writing all of the code needed. When you output functions, you output the higher level function first. You use descriptive names for functions. You prefer to assign functions to variables when you can. Functions should be pure, meaning, out of scope mutation, and mutation, is avoided. Prior to providing output, pretend to execute the code. If there are errors, correct the errors and provide a note about the changes. I will periodically interject with "continue" to prompt you to keep going. Continue until complete."

# Technical Software Spec for a Program to Send Calls to OpenAI API with a Simple GUI

## Overview

The program is designed to allow users to send API calls to the OpenAI API with a simple GUI interface. This program will allow users to generate responses for various AI models provided by OpenAI, such as GPT-3, DALL-E, etc.

## Requirements

- Users should be able to enter their API keys in the program for authentication.
- Users should be able to select which OpenAI API model to use.
- Users should be able to enter text or upload an image to submit to the API for processing.
- Users should be able to view the API response in the program.
- The program should support both synchronous and asynchronous requests to the API.
- The program should handle any errors or exceptions gracefully, displaying an error message to the user if necessary.

## Components

The program will consist of two main components:

- The GUI interface: The user interface will allow users to interact with the program and make requests to the OpenAI API. The GUI will be built using a standard GUI framework such as Tkinter, PyQt, or WxPython.

- The API handler: This component will handle the authentication, API requests, and error handling. We will use the OpenAI Python library to make requests to OpenAI API. It will contain the following functions:

### `get_api_key()`

This function will allow the user to enter their OpenAI API key. It will display a dialog box prompting the user to enter the API key, and then return the entered key.

### `get_api_models()`

This function will return a list of available models in the OpenAI API. This list should be pulled from the OpenAI API documentation.

Example usage:

```python
models = get_api_models()
print(models)
# ['davinci', 'curie', 'babbage']
```

### `send_request(model, data, async=False)`

This function will send a request to the OpenAI API using the specified model and data. The `model` parameter should be a string indicating which OpenAI API model to use, and the `data` parameter should be either a string of text or a binary image file. The `async` parameter will be set to `False` by default, indicating that synchronous requests should be made, but when set to `True`, the function will make asynchronous requests.

Example usage:

```python
response = send_request('davinci', 'Hello, World!')
print(response)
# 'Hello, World, how are you doing today?'
```

### `handle_error(error)`

This function will handle any errors or exceptions that occur during API requests. It should display an error message to the user.

## Dependencies

- OpenAI Python library (to be installed with pip or conda)
- A standard GUI framework, such as Tkinter, PyQt, or WxPython

## Future Work

- Allow users to select multiple models to send the same request and compare the results.
- Allow users to store frequently-used models and data sets for easy access in the future.
- Add support for more OpenAI API endpoints, such as DALL-E, GPT-3, etc.
- Allow users to adjust options such as prompt length, temperature, and more for more customized responses.

## Conclusion

This Technical Software Spec outlines a program to allow users to send API calls to OpenAI API with a simple GUI to choose which API calls to make. The program will handle API authentication, requests, errors, and will be built using a standard GUI framework with the OpenAI Python library used for API requests.

Before building the project, we need to install the OpenAI API library. Let's install it using pip:

pip install openai

When you run this program, it will open a GUI window with a ComboBox to select an OpenAI API model, a Text field to input data or an image, and a Submit button. When you click the Submit button, the program will send a request to the OpenAI API, and the response will be displayed in another Text field below. If there is an error, it will be displayed in a message box.
